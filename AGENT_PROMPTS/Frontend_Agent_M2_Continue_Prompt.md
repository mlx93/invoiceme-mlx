# Frontend Agent M2 - Continue Implementation

Continue M2 implementation by completing the remaining extended feature pages: implement Recurring Invoices pages (`/recurring-invoices/page.tsx` for template list, `/recurring-invoices/new/page.tsx` for template creation with frequency selection and line items, plus pause/resume/complete actions), Refunds UI (`/invoices/[id]/refund/page.tsx` for issue refund form with amount validation and reason, plus refund history display), and User Management pages (`/users/pending/page.tsx` for SysAdmin to view pending user registrations with approve/reject actions). Follow the established MVVM pattern using existing hooks (extend useInvoices for refunds, create useRecurringInvoices hook, create useUsers hook), reference `/frontend/FRONTEND_AGENT_REPORT.md` and `/frontend/INVOICE_PAGES_COMPLETE.md` for implementation patterns, and ensure all pages include RBAC enforcement, form validation (React Hook Form + Zod), error handling (RFC 7807 Problem Details), and mobile responsiveness.
